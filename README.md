# Granthdindi - Inventory Management Android Application for a non-profit organization "Jeevanvidya Mission"

The Jeevanvidya Mission NGO Android App is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline sales and inventory management for the Jeevanvidya Mission NGO. The app is developed using Java programming language and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It also utilizes XML for layout design and integrates with Google Cloud Firestore for efficient data storage.

# Features
**Sales Tracking:** The app enables the NGO to track sales activities efficiently. Sales transactions can be recorded, including details such as products sold, quantity, and transaction dates.

**Inventory Management:** The app offers inventory management capabilities, allowing the NGO to monitor stock levels, product details, and restocking needs. Automatic notifications can be set up to alert when inventory levels are low.

**User-Friendly Interface:** The user interface is designed for ease of use, ensuring that NGO staff members can quickly record sales and manage inventory without complications.

**Model-View-Controller Architecture:** The app is structured using the MVC architectural pattern, promoting the separation of concerns. The model represents the data and business logic, the view handles the UI components, and the controller manages the interactions between the model and the view.

**Google Cloud Firestore Integration:** Data storage and retrieval are facilitated through Google Cloud Firestore, a scalable and reliable cloud database. This ensures data is securely stored and easily accessible.

**Offline read/writes:** The app is designed to work seamlessly even in areas with unreliable internet connectivity. It enables offline read/writes to the Google Cloud Firestore database, ensuring that data can be accessed and updated even in rural areas with no/limited internet access.
